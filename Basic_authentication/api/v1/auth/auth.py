auth.py

This module defines the Auth class, which serves as a template for implementing
authentication systems in a Flask-based API. It provides methods to determine
if authentication is required for a given path, retrieve the authorization
header from a request, and obtain the current user associated with a request.

Classes:
    Auth: Template class for authentication logic.

Type Variables:
    User: Generic type variable representing a user object.

Methods:
    require_auth(path: str, excluded_paths: List[str]) -> bool:
        Determines if authentication is required for the specified path,
        based on a list of excluded paths.

    authorization_header(request=None) -> str:
        Retrieves the authorization header from the provided Flask request
        object, if present.

    current_user(request=None) -> User:
        Returns the current user associated with the request. This is a
        placeholder method to be implemented in subclasses.
